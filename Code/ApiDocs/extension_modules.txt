/** \page extension_modules Extension Modules
An additional method file must contain the following functions:
\code
LINKAGE int start_idl(const char* pLocation, External* pServices, const char** pOutput, const char** pErrorOutput);
LINKAGE void execute_idl(const char* pCommand, const char** pOutput, const char** pErrorOutput, Progress* pProgress);
LINKAGE int close_idl();
\endcode
start_idl() will be passed the location of the IDL installation's <tt>idl.dll</tt>, an External which can be passwd to ModuleManager::setService() and output parameters for <tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt>.
start_idl() should return 0 on error and non-zero on success.
execute_idl() will be passed an IDL command string, output parameters for <tt>stdout</tt> and <tt>stderr</tt>, and an optional Progress reporting object.
close_idl() should return 0 on error and non-zero on success.
The method file must be linked against the same version of IDL as the main support plug-in.
The filename should match the naming convention of the installed support plug-in which is usually in the <tt>PlugIns</tt> directory and begins with <tt>IdlStart</tt>.
If the filename is <tt>IdlStart.dll</tt> a method file should be named <tt>MyIdlMethods.dll</tt>.
If the filename is <tt>IdlStart6.3.dll</tt> a method file should be named <tt>MyIdlMethods6.3.dll</tt>.
This corresponds to the version selected in the options dialog.

The <tt>IdlInterpreter/Modules</tt> configuration option should be overridden in a default configuration file.
The <tt>IdlStart</tt> entry should remain and additional method files added after the <tt>IdlStart</tt> entry.
Look in <tt>DefaultSettings/45-IDL.cfg</tt> for the configuration format.
